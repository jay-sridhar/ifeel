    <h2> Game rules </h2>
    <p> Every team will be asked a pre-surveyed question in a round-robin fashion. If you answer all the top listed answers for that question, you win 100 points.
    <p> You have 3 lives. With every wrong answer, you lose a life. If you run out of lives without completing all the listed answers, then the following teams have the option to steal your points (in a round-robin fashion).</p>
    <p> <i> Rules for stealing</i> <br> You do not have any lives when you steal. One wrong answer, and you are out!
        <br> If you successfully complete the other team's challenge, you get 100 points.
        <br> In summary, when you successfully steal, you get 100 points (out of your turn), and the other team loses the points they earned.
        <br> Note: When playing with more than 2 teams, only the team that was asked the original question will lose points when a 'steal' is successful. If no team manages to steal, the original team will keep the points they earned.
